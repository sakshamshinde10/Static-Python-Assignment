COVID-19 Data Analysis
This project involves cleaning, saving, and loading a COVID-19 dataset, handling specific data issues with custom exceptions, and performing basic analysis on the cleaned data.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle: [COVID-19 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report)

Instructions:
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Run `data_cleaning.py` to clean the dataset.
3. Run `file_handling.py` to save the cleaned data to `clean_covid_data.csv`.
4. Run `analysis.py` to perform basic analysis on the cleaned data.

Custom Exceptions

The `exceptions.py` file defines a custom exception `DataCleaningError` to handle issues during data cleaning.
